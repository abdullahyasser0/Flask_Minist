README: Simple Model Deployment with Flask
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a straightforward deployment of a machine learning model using Flask. The model accepts both drawings and photos for prediction. Users can interact with the application via an intuitive web interface, preview uploaded images, and receive real-time predictions. This project is a practical example of serving machine learning models in a web environment.

Features
Drawing Canvas: Users can draw directly on the canvas, and the model predicts the drawn input.
Image Upload: Users can upload a photo for prediction.
Image Preview: Users can preview the uploaded image before submitting it.
Real-Time Predictions: Predictions for both drawings and photos are displayed instantly.
Responsive Design: Fully functional on desktop and mobile devices, including touch input.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.10+
Docker: For containerized deployment (optional).
Flask: For the web application framework.
TensorFlow/Keras: To load and run the machine learning model.
Gunicorn (optional): For deploying in a production environment.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-model-deployment.git
cd simple-model-deployment
Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the Model: Place your pre-trained model file (minist_model.keras) in the root directory.

Directory Structure: Ensure your project directory has the following structure:

arduino
Copy code
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ upload.html
â”œâ”€â”€ static/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mycss.css
â”œâ”€â”€ minist_model.keras
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
Using Docker
Build the Docker Image: Ensure Docker is installed and running, then build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t flask-mnist-app .
Run the Docker Container: Start a container from the built image:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-mnist-app
Access the Application: Open a browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:5000
Dockerfile
Hereâ€™s the Dockerfile used to containerize the application:

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use a Python base image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy project files into the container
COPY . .

# Install required system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    zlib1g-dev \
    libjpeg-dev \
    libpng-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python dependencies
RUN python -m venv /opt/venv && \
    . /opt/venv/bin/activate && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose Flask's default port
EXPOSE 5000

# Use Gunicorn to serve the Flask application
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "main:app"]
Running the Application
Start the Flask Server:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Access the Application: Open your browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Production Deployment: Use Gunicorn or Docker to serve the app in a production-ready environment.

How to Use
Drawing Input:

Use the canvas to draw a number or object.
Click Predict to send the drawing for prediction.
Image Upload:

Upload a photo using the file input field.
Preview the image on the screen.
Click Upload Photo to get the prediction.
View Predictions:

The predicted class is displayed instantly on the page.
Key Files
main.py: The Flask backend that handles image uploads, drawing input, and predictions.
templates/upload.html: The frontend HTML file for the user interface.
static/mycss.css: The CSS file for styling the interface.
minist_model.keras: The pre-trained model used for predictions.
Dockerfile: The Docker configuration for containerization.
Example Output
Draw or upload a number or object.
The application processes the input and returns the result:
vbnet
Copy code
Predicted Class: 7
Customization
Model: Replace minist_model.keras with your own trained model.
Classes: Update the labels array in main.py to match your model's output classes.
Styling: Edit mycss.css or HTML templates to customize the look and feel.
