### README: Simple Model Deployment with Flask

---

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple deployment of a machine learning model using Flask. The model predicts the class of an uploaded image, and users can see a preview of the image before submitting it. This lightweight application is designed to showcase how to serve machine learning models in a web environment.

---

#### Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image for prediction.
- **Image Preview**: Users can preview the image before submission.
- **Prediction Display**: The application displays the predicted class of the image.
- **Simple User Interface**: A clean and user-friendly interface for interaction.

---

#### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Flask**: For the web application framework.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: To load and run the machine learning model.

---

#### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-model-deployment.git
   cd simple-model-deployment
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install flask tensorflow
   ```

3. **Prepare the Model**:
   Place your pre-trained model (`minist_model.keras`) in the root directory.

4. **Directory Structure**:
   Ensure the directory structure looks like this:
   ```
   project/
   ├── app.py
   ├── templates/
   │   └── upload.html
   ├── static/
   │   └── mycss.css
   ├── minist_model.keras
   ```

---

#### Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Server**:
   Run the application using:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   Open a browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

---

#### How to Use

1. Upload an image using the provided file input field.
2. Preview the image on the screen to confirm the selection.
3. Click the **Upload Photo** button to send the image for prediction.
4. The predicted class will be displayed on the page.

---

#### Key Files

- **`app.py`**: The Flask backend to handle image uploads and predictions.
- **`templates/upload.html`**: The frontend HTML file for the user interface.
- **`static/mycss.css`**: Optional CSS file for additional styling.
- **`minist_model.keras`**: The pre-trained machine learning model.

---

#### Example Output

1. **User uploads an image.**
2. **The application previews the image.**
3. **After submission, the predicted class is displayed as:**
   ```
   Predicted Class: 7
   ```

---

#### Customization

- **Model**: Replace `minist_model.keras` with your trained model.
- **Labels**: Update the `labels` array in `app.py` to match your model's output classes.
- **Styling**: Modify the `mycss.css` file or inline styles for a custom look.
